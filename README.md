# EXP 1:
#Loading and Merging Datasets in Python
<br>
What is Dataset Loading?
Loading a dataset means importing data from an external source into a Python environment for analysis.
In data analysis and machine learning, we often work with multiple datasets containing related information. To get a complete picture, we need to load and merge these datasets efficiently.

For example, in a business setting:

One dataset may contain customer details (ID, Name, Age).
Another dataset may contain purchase history (ID, Items Bought, Amount Spent).
By merging these datasets, we can analyze customer behavior.
